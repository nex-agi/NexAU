type: tool
name: read_many_files
description: >-
  Reads content from multiple files specified by glob patterns within a
  configured target directory. For text files, it concatenates their content
  into a single string. It is primarily designed for text-based files. However,
  it can also process image (e.g., .png, .jpg), audio (e.g., .mp3, .wav), and
  PDF (.pdf) files if their file names or extensions are explicitly included in
  the 'include' argument. For these explicitly requested non-text files, their
  data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g.,
  base64 encoded).

  This tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of
  files, such as:
  - Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files
    in the 'src' directory).
  - Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad
    questions about code.
  - Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs'
    directory).
  - Gathering context from multiple configuration files.
  - When the user asks to "read all files in X directory" or "show me the
    content of all Y files".

  Use this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several
  files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files,
  it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between
  file contents. The tool inserts a '--- END REFERENCE CONTENT ---' after the
  last file. Ensure glob patterns are relative to the target directory. Glob
  patterns like 'src/**/*.js' are supported. Avoid using for single files if a
  more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user
  specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this
  tool. Other binary files (not explicitly requested as image/audio/PDF) are
  generally skipped. Default excludes apply to common non-text files (except for
  explicitly requested images/audio/PDFs) and large dependency directories
  unless 'useDefaultExcludes' is false.
