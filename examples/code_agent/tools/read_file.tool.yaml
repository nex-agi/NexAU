  Reads and returns the content of a specified file. If the file is large, the
  content will be truncated. The tool's response will clearly indicate if
  truncation has occurred and will provide details on how to read more of the
  file using the 'offset' and 'limit' parameters. Handles text, images (PNG,
  JPG, GIF, WEBP, SVG, BMP), audio files (MP3, WAV, AIFF, AAC, OGG, FLAC), and
  PDF files. For text files, it can read specific line ranges.
