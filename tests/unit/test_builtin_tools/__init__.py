Unit tests for builtin tools.

This module contains unit tests for each builtin tool in the nexau framework.
Each test should focus on a single tool's functionality in isolation.

# Integration tests for builtin tools are in tests/integration/test_tool_integration.py
# Future imports (to be implemented)

# from .test_mcp import *
# from .test_llm_friendly import *
