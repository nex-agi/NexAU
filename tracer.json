Then, I'll pinpoint the three presidents who preceded that individual. Finally, for each of those three, I'll need to dig up the name of their respective fathers. No problem, I can't think of anything else that's relevant at this point. I'll leverage a `WebSearch` to get the necessary data. That should be straightforward.\n",

The question requires identifying the fathers of the three presidents immediately preceding the president in 2015. Easy enough.\n\nFirst, let's establish our baseline: In 2015, the president was Barack Obama. Now, we go backwards.\n\n*   Before Obama (44th) was George W. Bush (43rd).\n*   Before G.W. Bush (43rd) was Bill Clinton (42nd).\n*   And before Clinton (42nd) was George H.W. Bush (41st).\n\nNow, let's identify the father for each:\n\n*   George H.W. Bush's father was Prescott Bush.\n*   Bill Clinton's biological father was William Jefferson Blythe Jr.\n*   And, as we already established, George W. Bush's father was, of course, George H.W. Bush.\n\nThere you have it. The fathers are Prescott Bush, William Jefferson Blythe Jr., and George H.W. Bush. Done.\n",
