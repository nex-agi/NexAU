# Welcome to the Northau Framework

Northau is a general-purpose agent framework inspired by Claude Code's architecture for building intelligent agents with tool capabilities.

## Features

- **Modular Tool System**: Easy-to-configure tools with YAML-based configuration.
- **Agent Architecture**: Create specialized agents with different capabilities.
- **Built-in Tools**: File operations, web search, bash execution, and more.
- **LLM Integration**: Support for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, etc.).
- **Custom LLM Generators**: Customize LLM behavior with custom preprocessing, caching, logging, and provider switching.
- **YAML Configuration**: Define agents and tools declaratively.

## Todos
- [ ] Currently, sub-agent context is destoryed after sub-agent finishes. Sometimes, deliverables may be done by sub-agents and users want to interact with these sub-agents. We need to support persistent sub-agents.
- [ ] Currently, event streaming requires developers to use hooks to implement custom event streaming logics. A better design is a unified hook class with on_xxx events to provide a unified interface for event streaming.
